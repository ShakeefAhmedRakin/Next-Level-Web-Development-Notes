## What Is Aggregation ?

In MongoDB, aggregation refers to the process of transforming and combining documents in a collection to perform analytics and obtain valuable insights. It involves using an aggregation pipeline, which is a series of stages that documents pass through sequentially. Each stage performs a specific operation on the data, such as filtering, grouping, sorting, or computing aggregations, allowing for powerful and flexible data processing.

```C++
db.collection.aggregrate (
    [
        // stage 1
        {},
        // stage 2
        {},
        // stage 3
        {}
    ]
)
```
